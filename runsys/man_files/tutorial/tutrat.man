RATFOR PRIMER
.TE
.oh 'Tutorial Section''Ratfor Primer'
.eh 'Ratfor Primer''Tutorial Section'
.PP
Ratfor is a preprocessor for Fortran.
Its primary purpose is to encourage readable and well-structured code
while taking advantage of the universality, portability, and
efficiency of Fortran.
This is done by providing the control structures not available in bare
Fortran, and by improving the "cosmetics" of the language.
.PP
Ratfor allows for all the features of normal Fortran, plus makes
available these control structures:
.DS
"if"-"else"
"while", "for", and "repeat"-"until" for looping
"break" and "next" for controlling loop exits
"switch" construct for allowing selection of alternatives
statement grouping with braces
.DE
.PP
The cosmetic aspects of ratfor have been designed to make it concise
and reasonably pleasing to the eye:
.DS
free form input
unobtrusive comment convention
translation of >, <=, etc. into .GT., .LE., etc.
string data type
quoted character strings
"define" statement for symbolic constants
"include" statement for including source files
.DE
.PP
Ratfor is implemented as a preprocessor which translates the
above features into Fortran, which can then be fed into almost
any Fortran compiler.
.PP
Each of the ratfor features will now be discussed in more detail.
In the following, a "statement" is any legal statement in Fortran:
assignment, declaration, subroutine call, I/O, etc., or any of
the ratfor statements themselves.
Any Fortran or ratfor statement or group of these can be enclosed
in braces ({}) or brackets ([]) - to make it a compound
statement, which is then
equivalent to a single statement and usable anywhere a single
statement can be used.
.H
IF-ELSE
.PP
Ratfor provides an "else" statement to handle the construction
"if a condition is true, do this thing, otherwise do that thing".
The syntax is
.DS
if (legal Fortran condition)
.RS
statement(s)
.RE
else
.RS
statement(s)
.RE
.DE
where the "else" part is optional.  The "legal Fortran condition" is
anything that can legally go into a Fortran logical IF.
The ratfor statements may be one or more valid ratfor or Fortran
statements of any kind.
If more than one statement is desired, the statements must be
enclosed by braces.  For example,
.DS
if (a > b)
.RS
{
k = 1
call remark (...)
}
.RE
else if (a < b)
.RS
{
k = 2
call remark (...)
}
.RE
else
.RS
return
.RE
.DE
.H
WHILE
.PP
Ratfor provides a while statement, which is simply a loop:
"while some condition is true, repeat this group of statements." 
The syntax is
.DS
while (legal Fortran condition)
.RS
statement(s)
.RE
.DE
.LP
As with the if, "legal Fortran condition" is something that can go
into a Fortran logical IF.
The condition is tested before execution of any of the ratfor statements,
so if the condition is not met, the loop will be executed zero times.
Also, as with the IF, the ratfor statements can be any valid ratfor
or Fortran constructs.  If more than one statement is desired, the
statements must be enclosed by braces.  For example,
.DS
while (getc(c) != EOF)
.RS
{
c = cnvt (c)
call putc (c)
}
.RE
.DE
.H
FOR
.PP
The "for" statement is similar to the "while" except that it
allows explicit initialization and increment
steps as part of the statement.  The syntax is
.DS
for (init; condition; increment)
.RS
statement(s)
.RE
.DE
where "init" is any single Fortran statement which gets done once
before the loop begins.  "Increment" is any single Fortran statement
which gets done at the end of each pass through the loop, before the
test.
"Condition" is again anything that is legal in a logical IF.
Any of init, condition, and increment may be omitted, although
the semicolons must remain.  A non-existent condition is treated
as always true, so "for( ; ; )" is an indefinite repeat.
The "for" statement is particularly useful for backward loops,
chaining along lists, loops that might be done zero times, and
similar things which are hard to express with a DO statement.
Here are two examples of "for" loops:
.DS
for (i=1; getarg(i, file, MAXLINE) != EOF; i=i+1)
.RS
{
int = open (file, READ)
while (getlin (line, int) != EOF)
.RS
{
for (j=80; j>0; j=j-1)
.RS
call putc (line(j))
.RE
}
.RE
call close (int)
}
.RE
.DE
The above code simply reads cards from a list of files, reverses
the order of the characters, and writes the cards onto a standard
output file.
(The "!=" means .NE.)
.H
REPEAT-UNTIL
.LP
The "repeat-until" statements allow for repetition of a group
of statements until a specified condition is met.
The syntax is:
.DS
repeat
.RS
statement(s)
.RE
until
.RS
condition
.RE
.DE
The "until" is optional.
Once again, if more than one ratfor statement is desired, the
statements must be enclosed by brackets.
If the "until" part is omitted, the result is an infinite loop
which must be broken with a "break" or "next" statement (described
below).
An example of a repeat-until loop is:
.DS
repeat
.RS
{
call putc (BLANK)
col = col + 1
}
until (tabpos(col,tabs) == YES)
.RE
.DE
.H
BREAK and NEXT
.PP
Ratfor provides statements for leaving a loop early and for
beginning the next iteration.
.PP
"Break" causes an immediate exit
from whatever loop it is contained in (which may be a "while",
"for", or "repeat").  Control resumes with the next statement
after the loop.
Only one loop is terminated by a "break", even if the "break"
is contained inside several nested loops.
For example:
.DS
repeat
.RS
{
if (getc(c) == EOF)  break
 ...
}
.RE
.RE
.PP
"Next" is a branch to the bottom of the loop, so it causes the
next iteration to be done.
"Next" goes to the condition part of a "while" or "until",
to the top of an infinite "repeat" loop, and to the
reinitialize part of a "for".
For example:
.DS
for (i=1; i<10; i=i+1)
.RS
{
if (array(i) == BLANK)  next
 ...
}
.RE
.DE
.H
SWITCH Construct
.LP
An assortment of alternatives may be specified using the switch
construct.
The syntax is:
.DS
switch (expr)
.RS
{
case a: statement
case b: statement
case c: statement
 ...
default: statement
}
.RE
.RE
.PP
The "default" case is optional.
An example of a switch/case construct is:
.DS
switch (i)
.RS
{
case 25: do_this_stuff
case -2: do_this_stuff
default: otherwise do_this
}
.RE
.DE
.H
STATEMENT GROUPING and NULL STATEMENTS
.PP
Ratfor allows a group of statements to be treated as a unit by
enclosing them in braces - "{" and "}".
This is true throughout the language:
wherever a single ratfor statement can be used, there could also be
several enclosed in braces.
For example:
.DS
if (x > 100)
.RS
{
call error (...)
err = 1
return
}
.RE
.RE
.PP
If braces are not valid characters in the local operating system,
the characters "$(" and "$)" may be used instead of "{" and
"}" respectively.
.PP
Ratfor also allows for null statements, most useful after
"for" and "while" statements.  A semicolon alone indicates
a null statement.  For instance,
.DS
while (getlin(line, int) != EOF)  ;
.DE
would read lines from a file until the end-of-file was reached
and
.DS
for (i=1; line(i) == BLANK; i=i+1)  ;
.DE
positions after leading blanks in a line.
.H
FREE-FORM INPUT
.PP
Statements may be placed anywhere on a line and several may
appear on one line if they are separated by semicolons.
No semicolon is needed at the end of each line because
Ratfor assumes there is one statement per line unless told
otherwise.
Ratfor will, however, continue lines when it seems obvious that they
are not yet done.
.PP
Any statement that begins with an all-numeric field
is assumed to be a Fortran label and is
placed in columns 1-5 upon output.
.PP
Statements may be passed through the ratfor compiler unaltered
by inserting a percent sign (%) as the first character on
the line.
The percent will be removed, the rest of the line shifted
one position to the left, and the line sent out without
any changes.
This is a convenient way to pass regular Fortran or assembly
code through the ratfor compiler.
.H
COMMENTS
.PP
A sharp character "#" in a line marks the beginning of a comment
and the rest of the line is considered to be that comment.
Comments and code can co-exist on the same line.  For example,
.DS
function dummy (x)
# I made up this function to show some comments
dummy = x         #I am simply returning the parameter
return
end
.DE
.H
CHARACTER TRANSLATION
.PP
Sometimes the characters >, <=, etc. are easier to read in
Fortran condition
statements than the
standard Fortran .EQ., .LT., etc.
Ratfor allows either
convention.   If the special characters are used, they are translated
in the following manner:
.DS
==          .EQ.
!= ^= ~=    .NE.
<           .LT.
>           .GT.
<=          .LE.
>=          .GE.
|           .OR.
&           .AND.
.DE
For example,
.DS
for (i=1; i <= 5; i=i+1)
.RS
 ...
.RE
if (j != 100)
.RS
 ...
.RE
.DE
.H
STRING DATA TYPE
.LP
All character arrays in ratfor are sequences of ASCII characters,
stored right-adjusted, one per array element, with the string
terminated with an EOS marker.
An automatic way to initialize string characters arrays is
provided.
The syntax is:
.DS
string name "characters"
.RE
or
.RS
string name(n) "characters"
.DE
Ratfor will define name to be a character (or, more likely, integer)
array long enough to accomodate the ASCII codes for the
given character string, one per element.
The last word of name is initialized to EOS.
If a size is given, name is declared to be an integer array of
size 'n'.
If several string statements appear consecutively, the generated
declarations for the array will precede the data
statements that initialize them.
.PP
For example, the declarations:
.DS
string errmsg "error"
string done "bye"
.DE
would be converted by ratfor into the Fortran:
.DS
integer error(6)
integer done(4)
data error(1), error(2), error(3), error(4), error(5), error(6)
/LETE, LETR, LETR, LETO, LETR, EOS/
data done(1), done(2), done(3), done(4)
/LETD, LETO, LETN, LETE, EOS/
.DE
.H
QUOTED CHARACTER STRINGS
.PP
Text enclosed in matching double or single quotes is converted to
nH... format, but is otherwise unaltered.  For instance,
.DS
call remark ("Error detected")
.DE
would translate to
.DS
call remark (14hError detected)
.DE
and
.DS
data string /"Can't find answer"/
.DE
would become
.DS
data string /17hCan't find answer/
.DE
If the local operating system does not support both upper and lower
case hollerith strings, an escape mechanism is generally provided
to allow the user to indicate case.
.PP
Some operating systems are not capable of finding the end of a
Fortran hollerith string.
In this case it may be necessary for the user to mark the end of
the quoted string with a specific character, such as a period.
.H
DEFINE
.PP
Any string of alphanumeric characters can be defined as a name:
thereafter, whenever that name occurs in the input (delimited
by non-alphanumerics) it is replaced by the rest of the definition
line.
The syntax is:
.DS
define(name, replacement string)
.DE
which defines "name" as a macro which will be replaced with
"replacement string" when encountered in the source files.
As a simple example:
.DS
define(ROW,10)
define(COLUMN,25)
dimension array (ROW, COLUMN)
.DE
and
.DS
define(EOF,-1)
if (getlin(line, fd) == EOF) ...
.DE
.PP
Definitions may be included anywhere in the code, as long as they
appear before the defined name occurs.
The names of macro may contain letters, digits, periods, and
underline characters, but must start with a letter.
Upper and lower cases ARE significant (thus EOF is not the same
as eof).
.PP
Any occurrences of the strings
'$n' in the replacement text,
where 1 <= n <= 9, will be replaced with the
nth argument when the macro is actually invoked.  For example:
.DS
define(bump, $1 = $1 + 1)
.DE
will cause the source line
.DS
bump(i)
.DE
to be expanded into
.DS
i = i + 1
.DE
.PP
In addition to
.I define,
four other built-in macros are provided:
.nr z @ni
.nr i 16
.IP
arith(x,op,y)   performs the integer arithmetic specified by "op" (+,-,*,/)
on the two numeric operands and returns the result as its replacement.
.IP
incr(x)         converts the string x to a number, adds one to it, and returns
the value as its replacement (as a character string).
.IP
ifelse(a,b,c,d) compares a and b as character strings:  if they are the same,
c is pushed back onto the input, else d is pushed back.
.IP
substr(s,m,n)   produces the substring of s which starts at position m
(with origin one), of length n.  If n is omitted or too big, the rest of
the string is used, while if m is out of range the result is a null string.
.nr i @nz
.H
INCLUDE
.PP
Files may be inserted into the input stream via the "include"
command.
The statement
.DS
include filename
.RE
or
.RS
include "filename"
.DE
inserts the lines found in file "filename" into the
ratfor input in place of the "include" statement.  This is
especially useful for inserting common blocks.  For example,
.DS
function exampl (x)
include comblk
exampl = x + z
return
end
.DE
might translate into
.DS
function exampl (x)
common /comblk/ q, r, z
exampl = x + z
return
end
.DE
.H
IMPLEMENTATION
.PP
Ratfor was originally written in C, a high-level language, on the
UNIX operating system.
Our version is written in ratfor itself, originally brought up
by a bootstrap written in Fortran.
.PP
Ratfor generates code by reading input files and translating any
ratfor keywords into standard Fortran.  Thus, if the first
token (word) on a source line is not a keyword (like "for", "while",
etc.) the entire statement is simply copied to the output with
appropriate character translation and formatting.
Ratfor knows very little
Fortran and thus does not handle any Fortran error
detection.
Errors in ratfor keyword syntax are generally noted by a message
to the user's terminal along with an indication of the source line number
which caused the problem.
.H
CONCLUSIONS
.PP
Ratfor demonstrates that with modest effort Fortran-based
programmers can increase their productivity by using
a language that provides them with the control structures
and cosmetic features essential for structured programming
design.
Debugging and subsequent revision times are much faster
than the equivalent efforts in Fortran, mainly because
the code can be easily read.  Thus it becomes easier to
write code that is readable, reliable, and even esthetically
pleasing,
as well as being portable to other environments.
.H
EXAMPLE
.PP
The following is a sample ratfor tool designed to show
some of the commonly-used ratfor commands.  The routine
reads through a list of files, counting the lines as it goes.
.DS
# This is an example of a routine written in ratfor
# Symbols such as EOF, ERR, MAXLINE, character and filedes
# are automatically defined (i.e. a file containing them is
# included) by ratfor
.sp
## count - counts lines in files
DRIVER(count)
include comblk	# this file contains a common block
		# which contains a variable "linect"
.sp
character file(FILENAMESIZE), line(MAXLINE)
integer i
filedes fd
integer getarg, open, getlin
.sp
call query ("usage:  count file")
linect = 0
.sp
#loop through the list of files
for (i=1; getarg(i, file, FILENAMESIZE) != EOF; i=i+1)
.RS
{
fd = open (file, READ)      # open (attach) the file
if (fd == ERR)              # file not found
.RS
call cant (file)
.RE
while (getlin(line, fd) != EOF)   # read, count lines
.RS
linect = linect + 1
.RE
call close (fd)              # close the file
}
.RE
.sp
call putlin(total, STDOUT)
call putint (linect, 5, STDOUT)
call putch (NEWLINE, STDOUT)
DRETURN
end
