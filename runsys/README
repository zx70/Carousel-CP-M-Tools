The  Proprietary  Library Source Package supplies the source code necessary to
rebuild  the  files  provided  only  in  binary   format   in   the   Carousel
Build-a-ToolKit (tm). 

The following files are on this diskette: 

   README      -- this file
   HOWTO       -- complete instructions
   CMTLIB.RAT  -- source code for CMTLIB.336, CMTLIB.344
   RUNSYS.AR   -- source code, include files, and shell scripts for
                       run system (both executable and stub versions)
   RUN.AR      -- source code and shell script for RUN.COM
   RSH.AR      -- source code and shell script for SH.COM
   SH.AR       -- source code for SH.TOL
   INSTALL.AR  -- source code for INSTALL.TOL

                             SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONS

1) DO  NOT write on this diskette.  Do not erase or rename any of the files on
   it.  It is your MASTER DISK.  Keep it safe!  Make backup copies of it right
   away. 

2) You need the Carousel Build-a-ToolKit  (which  includes  the  Use-a-ToolKit
   (tm)) in order to rebuild the Tools. 

3) In  addition,  you need a copy of the Microsoft Fortran-80 compiler and its
   associated macroassembler, linker, and librarian.  These utilities exist in
   two incompatible versions:  "old" (pre-3.40) and "new"  (3.40  and  later).
   You  can build working Tools using either version with the Build-a-ToolKit.
   However, you need the old version in order to rebuild  RUN.COM  (containing
   the  real  run  system)  conveniently.   Some  of  the  binary files in the
   Build-a-ToolKit are supplied in both versions:   if  you  want  to  rebuild
   both, then you will need both versions of the compiler. 

4) Print  a  copy  of the file HOWTO and study it before attempting to rebuild
   anything.
