  crt is used to show lines of input on the terminal, one screenful at a
  time.  After each set of lines is printed, crt will wait for instructions
  from the user.  Hitting a carriage-return will cause the next screenful of
  lines to appear; typing "q" (quit) will cause crt to skip to the next file
  (if any); and hitting an end-of-file character will cause crt to stop
  immediately. 

  The number of lines to be printed on the terminal can be changed by
  utilizing the flag -N, where N is the number of lines desired, instead of
  the default of 23 lines. 

  crt will stop at the end of each file as well as after each screenful of
  lines.  If no files are specified or a dash (-) is typed in place of a file
  name, the files will be read from the standard input.
