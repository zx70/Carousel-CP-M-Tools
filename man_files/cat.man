  cat reads each text file specified and writes it to standard output.  If no
  file names are given or a dash (-) is entered in place of a file name, cat
  will read the standard input.

  cat file
    print file on the terminal. 

  cat file1 file2 > file3
    concatenate file1 and file2 and write the result to file3. 

  cat > xyz
    put all following lines entered from the terminal, up to a line that
    begins with an end-of-file character, onto file xyz.  This is an easy way
    to create a short file. 

  cat x.1 - x.2 > x.all
    copy file x.1 then some lines from the terminal (terminated by a line
    with just the end-of-file character) then file x.2 to the file x.all.

  terminated.

  Like most of the Software Tools, cat only works with text files.  Use the
  cp Tool to copy any type of file. 

  Using the same file for output as well as input will cause that file to be
  emptied.
