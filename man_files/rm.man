  rm removes (deletes) the specified files.  The verbose (-v) option causes
  rm to print the name of each file as it is removed. 

  The ask ( -a') option causes rm to print the message

    name ?

  for each file name that is to be removed and to read one line from the
  user's terminal.  If the line begins with "y", the file is removed.  If the
  line begins with "q", no further files in the list are removed.  If the
  line begins with "g", the file and all subsequent files in the list are
  removed, and the ask ( -a') option is turned off.  If the line begins with
  anything else, the file is not removed. 

  If a dash (-) is entered as an argument, the names of files to be removed
  will be read from standard input, one per line.

  Watch out for the "g" response when using the ask ( -a') flag and a list
  from standard input of files to be removed -- it will cause all  of the
  files left on the list to be deleted without prompting.
