  show copies the named files to the standard output, replacing control
  characters by "^c", where c is the ASCII character used to enter the
  control character when depressing the "control" key on most terminals.
  More precisely, c is the ASCII character whose value is 100 octal plus the
  value of the control character. 

  Control characters are those ASCII characters with values between 0 and 31,
  inclusive.  Newline characters are displayed as usual, however. 

  If no file names are given or a dash (-) is entered in place of a file
  name, show will read from the standard input.
