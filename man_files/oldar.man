  This old version of ar is included for those people who may have archives
  written with an earlier version of the Carousel Tools.

  oldar collects text files into one big file and maintains that file as an
  archive.  Files can be extracted from, added to, deleted from, or replaced
  in the archive, and information about the contents can be listed. 

  Archives are useful for keeping collections of related files together.
  They provide an easy way to make and maintain backups.  In addition, a
  collection of files in an archive takes less disk space that is used by the
  individual files. 

  Files that are added to archives can, of course, be archive files
  themselves.  Theoretically, there is no limit to the number of files that
  can be nested this way.  Thus, oldar provides the utility necessary to
  maintain tree-structured file directories. 

  The optional file names in the oldar statement line specify individual
  files that are to participate in the action.  If no files are named, the
  oldar command is performed on all of the files in the archive; but if any
  files are explicitly named, they are the only files upon which the command
  is performed.  The exception is the delete (d) option for which all of the
  files to be deleted must be specified.  Therefore, if you wish to delete
  all of the files in an archive, it is easiest to remove the whole archive
  using rm. 

  If a dash (-) is given as a file name, further file names are read from the
  standard input, one per line. 

  ______Option _______Summary       
  -u Create, update or add to an archive.  Creates a new archive if
    archive-file does not exist, replaces files that already exist in the
    archive with updated versions or adds new files to the end of the
    archive.  In all cases the file name(s) referenced in the oldar statement
    and the name(s) of the regular file(s) must be the same.  If the verbose
    (v) option is also used, the file names will be printed on the standard
    output as they are written to the archive file. 

  -x Extract file(s) from an archive.  The specified file(s) are copied from
    the archive onto regular files using the name referenced in the oldar
    statement.  If the verbose (v) option is added, the file names will be
    printed on the standard output as they are extracted. 

  -d Delete file(s) from an archive.  Only the file(s) specified in the oldar
    statement will be deleted.  If the verbose (v) option is added, the file
    names will be printed on the standard output as they are deleted from the
    archive. 

  -p Print file(s) on standard output.  Using the verbose (v) option will
    cause the file name to be printed before the file. 

  -t Print an archive table of contents.  Normally, the table will contain
    only the file name(s).  If the verbose (v) option is added, the table
    will also contain each file's length, type, and date and time of last
    change. 

  -s Salvage a damaged archive.  This option may be used to recover a damaged
    archive whose character counts do not reflect the correct number of
    characters in the file.  This option extracts all files from the archive,
    ignoring character counts, date and time stamps, etc. on the archive
    header lines; it simply uses "#-h-", which begins each archive member,
    and the file name which follows it.  The files are then replaced in the
    archive, with corrected character counts.  Thus, this option is useful
    for salvaging the contents of alien archive files and for saving damaged
    archives.  However, it does not work on nested archives (i.e., archives
    within archives). 

  -v Make output verbose.  This option may be concatenated to any of the
    above option and will cause the archiver to print additional
    information--generally file names--on the standard output.  Its specific
    action when concatenated with each option has already been described.

  ar -u book chap1 chap2 chap3
    Create or update an archive file called book and insert or update 3
    members in it -- chap1, chap2, and chap3

  ar -xv source rtnA rtnB
    From the archive file source, extract the members rtnA and rtnB and put
    them onto files named rtnA and rtnB.  Print the member names as they are
    extracted. 

  ar -t library
    List all the members of library. 

  ar -p book | format
    Send all members of the archive book to the formatter. 

  ar -uv somefile a b c | rm -
    Add or update in archive somefile members a, b and c, and then delete a,
    b and c from the file system (but not from somefile). 

  ls | ar -uv /a/archive -
    Updates and/or adds all of the files in the current working directory to
    archive in drive a.  The file names are displayed on standard output as
    the files are processed.

  archive not in proper format
    oldar did not find a header line where one was expected.  Typical reasons
    include misspelling the file name, using an existing file (not in archive
    format) on a creation run, and referencing an archive file that has been
    modified directly (say with the editor). 

  delete by name only
    For user protection files are allowed to be deleted from an archive only
    by specifying each file name to be deleted. 

  duplicate file name
    A file was listed more than once when calling oldar. 

  fatal errors -- archive not altered
    This message is generated whenever one or more of the other errors have
    been detected.  An archive is never altered unless everything has run
    properly. 

  too many file names
    oldar may not be called with more than 25 files. 

  usage: oldar statement line
    The statement line passed to the archiver is in error.  Possibly the
    command is wrong or the archived file name has not been given. 

  filename: can't add
    The file specified by filename does not exist or cannot be opened (e.g.,
    is locked). 

  filename: can't create
    The archiver could not generate a local file by the name of filename.
    Probably the archiver's internal file buffer space has been exceeded. 

  filename: not in archive
    oldar could not locate the file indicated by filename in the specified
    archived file.

  Only text file (i.e. not binary files such as .com and .tol files) can be
  archived. 

  The salvage (-s) option works properly only on archives that are not
  nested. 

  When the update (-u) and (-p) options are used the files are updated or
  printed in the order they appear on the archived file, not the order listed
  on the oldar statement line.
