  includ copies files to the standard output, except that any line that
  begins with

    include file
  or
    include "file"

  is replaced by the entire contents of file.  File names which contain
  non-alphanumeric characters must be inclosed in quotes.  If no files names
  are given or a dash (-) is specified in place of a file name, includ reads
  its standard input. 

  An included  file may  contain further include's.

    maximum number of opened files allowed on the particular system.
