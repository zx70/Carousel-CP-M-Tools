  tsort topologically sorts the symbols in the named files.  That is, the
  symbols are sorted according to the precedence or ordering relationship
  specified in the input data.  If no files are specified or a dash (-) is
  entered in place of a file name, tsort reads the standard input. 

  A symbol is considered any string of characters delimited by blanks or
  tabs.  It might represent a name, an action, an event, etc.  Each line of
  the input is assumed to be of the form

    a b c ...

  which states that symbol a precedes symbol b, a precedes c, and so on.
  Note that there is nothing implied about the ordering of b and c.  A line
  consisting of a single symbol simply declares that symbol without
  specifying any ordering relations about it.  The output is a topologically
  sorted list of symbols, one per line. 

  For example, suppose you have trouble getting up in the morning because you
  can't quite remember what actions have to be performed in which order.
  However, you do know that the first action in the following list precedes
  all others on the line:

    set_alarm   turn_off_alarm
    wake_up    get_out_of_bed    turn_off_alarm
    set_alarm     wake_up

  Using tsort to sort the above list would produce the following set of
  actions for getting out of bed:

    set_alarm
    wake_up
    turn_off_alarm
    get_out_of_bed

  tsort routines >liborder
    An obvious use of tsort is to prepare a sorted list of subroutine names
    and their dependencies on routines and tsort them so that the library can
    be properly ordered for the linker.

  circular
    The input specifies two symbols that must preceed each other. 

  out of storage
    The input is too large.  The size of tsort''s buffer is determined by the
    MAXBUF definition in the source code.
