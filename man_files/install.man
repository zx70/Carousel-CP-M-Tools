  install is actually two Tools combined into one.  First it is used with the
  -d flag to set the shell default directory information in the sh.com and
  run.com Tools.  Second it is used with files made using the Carousel
  runsys.rel library to build .tol files from .com files and to expand .tol
  files to .com files.  These things are described in detail in the System
  Specific section of the manual. 

  ________Changing ___the _______Default _____Shell _________Directory    
  To change the default shell directory specify the -d option and nothing
  else.  install will ask at the terminal for the drive and user number of
  the new default directory and record the information in the files run.com
  and sh.com in the current directory.  If you are using user numbers, when
  install is done you must copy sh.com to each user number you use.  This
  needs to be done only on the disk containing the default shell directory.
  See the System Specific section of the manual for more information. 

  ___________Compressing .___com _____Files ___and _________Expanding .___tol _____Files  
  Tools are distributed and used in the compressed .tol form.  This allows
  faster loading by overlaying the previous Tool with the next Tool.  It also
  saves disk space.  install is the only way to expand a file in .tol form to
  the CP/M .com command form, or compress a .com file to .tol form. 

  When expanding or compressing files install works on a list of files that
  can either be explicitly given, or read from standard input if the dash (-)
  flag is present.  If no flag options are specified the default is to
  compress the named files in the current directory. 

  The compress (-c) flag specifies compression from .com to .tol form.  The
  destination directory for the compressed tool(s) must be given after the
  -c.  If the files to be compressed are to come from a directory other than
  the current one, the source directory name can be specified following the
  -s flag. 

  The expand (-e) flag specifies expansion from .tol to .com form.  As with
  -c the destination directory must follow the -e, and the -s flag may be
  used to specify a source directory for the files to be converted.  An
  expanded file will be about 18K bytes larger than the compressed version. 

  We recommend that you keep the Tools as .tol files since they take less
  space and load faster in that form.

  install newtool
    compress newtool in the current directory. 

  install -c /2/b/ -s /1/b/ newtool
    compress a newly compiled tool in directory /1/b and put it in directory
    /2/b. 

  install -e /0/d/ -s /0/b/ tool
    expand tool on directory /0/b and put it in directory /0/d/.
