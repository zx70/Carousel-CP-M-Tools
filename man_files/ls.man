  ls lists files in a directory.  When no directory argument is given, the
  current directory is listed.  If another directory is desired, it must be
  given as the first (non-flag) argument and must include at least one slash
  (/) (e.g. /dir) or be in CP/M format (e.g. dir:).  Any other arguments
  given are considered to be patterns to match.  These arguments may include
  any of the legal regular expressions described in the manual entry for the
  ed tool. 

  If the standard output is a terminal or printer, the list of files is
  columnated.  If standard output is a disk file (or a pipeline), the files
  are listed one per line. 

  The files are sorted before listing. 

  _______Options _______Summary       
  -p list the files in the directory with the full pathname concatenated with
    them

  -v list additional information about the files

  -a list only those files which contain all pattterns given

  -x list only those files which contain none of the patterns given

  ls lists the files in the current directory

  ls -p > scr
    lists the full pathname of the files in the current directory and puts
    the output on file scr. 

  ls -v /a
    lists the files in directory a, along with additional information about
    them (size, etc.). 

  ls this that theother
    lists filenames containing the patterns this, that, or theother. 

  ls -x temp
    lists all filenames except those containing temp. 

  ls "a?*z"
    lists all filenames that contain an a, any other characters, (or none),
    and a z.  (The quotes are necessary when using the shell since the
    question mark (?) is a special shell character.)

  ls -a test rat
    lists all filenames containing both test and rat in their names (e.g.,
    test1.rat, etc.). 

  ls | rm -a -
    for each file in the current directory, rm asks the user if it is to be
    deleted.
