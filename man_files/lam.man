  lam laminates the named file(s)  and writes the lines to the standard
  output.  That is, the first output line is the result of concatenating the
  first lines of each file, and so on.  If the files are different lengths,
  null lines are used for the missing lines in the shorter files. 

  The -string argument(s) may be used to place strings in each output line.
  Each string is placed in the output lines at the point it appears in the
  argument list.  For example,

    lam "-file1: " foo1 "-, file2: " foo2

  results in output lines that look like

    file1: _________________a line from foo1, file2: ________________a line from foo2

  The escape sequences described in ed are valid in string arguments.  Thus

    lam foo1 -@n foo2

  results in the lines from foo1 and foo2 being interleaved. 

  Files and string specifications may appear in any order in the argument
  list.  If no file arguments are given or a dash (-) is entered in place of
  a file name, lam reads the standard input.

  lam file1 file2 >laminate
    takes lines from file1 and file2, joins them together and writes them to
    laminate

  lam file1 "-somewords " file2
    produces the following on the terminal:

      line_from_file1'somewords line_from_file2
      ...

  ls .doc | lam "-format macros " - "- > /lst" | sh -
    construct a format command line for each file in the current directory
    whose name contains .doc, and send it to the shell for execution. 

  ls /b/ | lam "-cp " - "- . " | sh
    copy all files in the current user number on disk b to the current
    directory.

  too many arguments
    The maximum number of command line arguments allowed has been exceeded.
    It is set by the MAXARGS definition in the source code. 

  too many strings
    The maximum number of characters in a string has been exceeded.  It is
    set by the MAXBUF definition in the source code. 

  output buffer exceeded
    The size of the output line buffer has been exceeded.  It is set by the
    MAXOBUF definition in the source code.
