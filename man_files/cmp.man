  file1 is compared line-by-line with file2.  If any lines differ, cmp
  announces the line number and prints each file's offending line.  If only
  one filename is given, file2 will be taken from the standard input. 

  cmp is the same as:

    diff -cv file1 file2

  cmp file1 file2
    compare file1 with file2, printing any lines that differ

  ar t archfile | cmp oldlist
    compare the table of contents of archfile with a previously saved list of
    contents, noting any differences (such as a change in size, differing
    date, etc.)

  comm - print lines common to two files
  diff - compare and list differences between files

  If the end of one file is reached before the end of the  other, a message
    is printed.

  If either file is binary, spurious results should be expected. 

  cmp cannot handle offset lines:  line N of file1 is simply compared to line
  N of file2.  Use diff if there may be offset lines.
