  mcol reads the named files and formats them into multicolumn output on the
  standard output.  If no file names are given or a dash (-) is entered in
  place of a file name, the standard input is used. 

  _______Options _______Summary       
  (All options are specified by the option flag followed by N, where N is a
  number.) 

  -cN Format the output into the specified number of columns.  The default is
    2. 

  -lN Set the page length to the spcified number of lines.  mcol produces its
    output in pages, but does not place separators between the pages on the
    assumption that some subsequent processor will do that.  The default page
    length is 55.  -l57 would be appropriate for use with pr. 

  -wN Set the column width to the specified number of characters.  Lines
    longer than the specified length are truncated.  The default column width
    is 60. 

  -gN Set the gutter width (the white space between columns) to the specified
    number of spaces.  The default gutter width is 8 spaces. 

  -dN Set various options for displaying a file on the terminal.  The page
    size is set to 24 lines.  The number of columns and gutter width are
    computed to maximize the amount of information on a single screen.  If
    the column width is not specified, 10 is used -- this is useful for
    displaying lists of file names.

  mcol -c3 -l22 -w20 document | crt
    prints document on the terminal.  The output is formatted into 3
    20-character columns, 22 lines to a page. 

  ar -t archfile | mcol -d
    list the table-of-contents for archfile on the terminal.  The output is
    formatted for the terminal. 

  mcol -c5 -l57 -w10 -g5 file | pr > /lst
    creates a five-column, 57-line page, with columns 10 characters wide and
    gutters 5 spaces wide.  The result is then piped through pr, which
    inserts headers and footer margins, and printed on the printer.

  invalid column count
  invalid page size
  invalid column width
  invalid gutter width
    The value of one of the option flags is invalid or exceeds the
    limitations of mcol. 

  ignoring invalid flag
    A command line option flag was given which mcol did not recognize. 

  insufficient buffer space
    mcol could not buffer an entire page.  This is usually the result of
    options that specify a large page size or many columns.  The buffer size
    is set by the MAXBUF definition in the source code. 

  too many lines
    The number of lines per page times the number of columns exceeded the
    line buffer space allotted to mcol.  The maximum number of lines allowed
    is set by the MAXPTR definition in the source code.
