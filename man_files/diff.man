  diff compares the contents of two files and reports on the differences
  between them.  The default behavior is to describe the insert, delete, and
  change operations that must be performed on file1 to convert its contents
  into those of file2. 

  file2 is optional.  If it is omitted, the standard input is read for the
  text of file2. 

  The following flags may be specified:

  -c Perform a simple line-by-line comparison.  diff will compare successive
    lines of the input files; if any corresponding lines differ, or if one
    file is shorter than the other, diff prints the message "different" and
    exits.  If the files are the same, diff produces no output.  When the
    verbose (v) option is also specified, diff prints the lines that differ
    along with their line number in the input file and notifies the user if
    one file is shorter than the other. 

  -d List the insertions, deletions, and changes that will convert file1 into
    file2.  This is the default option.  If the verbose (v) option is also
    specified, unchanged text will also be listed. 

  -r Copy file2 to standard output with format requests inserted for revision
    bars and deletion asterisks.  This option is particularly useful for
    maintenance of large documents, like Tools reference manuals. 

  -s Output a script of commands for the text editor that will enable ed to
    convert file1 into file2.  This is handy for preparing updates to large
    programs or data files, since generally the volume of changes required
    will be much smaller than the new text in its entirety. 

  -v Make output verbose.  This option may be used with the -c and -d options
    discussed above to produce more information.

  diff myfile1 myfile2
    Print on the terminal the differences between myfile1 and myfile2. 

  diff -cv file file.old
    Does a simple line-by-line comparison on the two files, printing lines
    which differ.  Same as

      cmp file file.old

  diff -s old new | ed - old
    Make an ed script which changes old into new. 

  diff -s old new >> o-to-n
    To keep a list of changes made to an original source file. 

  diff -r old.doc new.doc | format > /lst
    print a formatted copy of new.doc with revisions and deletions noted.

  <file>:  can't open
    either file1 or file2 is not readable. 

  file too large to handle
    The size of the buffer is set by the MAXLINES definition in the source
    code. 

  <file> too many unique lines
    The files are too dissimilar for diff to be able to list all the
    differences.

  diff is based on the algorithm found in _A _________Technique ___for _________Isolating

  21, issue 4 (April 1978), pages 264-268.  The algorithm used has one
  quirk:  a line or a block of lines which is not unique within a file will
  be labeled as an insertion (deletion) if its immediately adjacent neighbors
  both above and below are labeled as insertions (deletions).
