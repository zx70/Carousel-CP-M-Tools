  comm reads file1 and file2 and produces a three column output: lines only
  in file1, lines only in file2, and lines common to both files.  The files
  should be sorted before they are read by comm.  Entering a dash (-) in
  place of a filename will cause the standard input to be read.  If there is
  only one file name entered, the standard input will be read in place of
  file2.  The optional flags specify the columns to print:

  -1 Show column 1; the lines only in file1 will be listed. 

  -2 Show column 2; the lines only in file2 will be listed. 

  -3 Show column 3; the lines common to both files will be listed. 

  The flags may be concatenated in any combination.  The default is -123.

  comm george harry
    compare george and harry, which are sorted, and list those lines that
    appear in george only, in harry only, and in both files. 

  ls | comm -2 oldlist
    list those files which are on the directory now but did not appear in
    oldlist. 

  tr <document A-Z a-z |@
  tr !a-z "@n" |@
  sort |@
  uniq |@
  comm -2 dictionary
    convert all letters in document to lower case, put each word on a line by
    itself, sort the list and strip out duplicates, then print all those
    words in the list but not in dictionary - a rudimentary spelling
    checker.  (The at sign (@) after the pipe (|) indicates a continuation of
    the command line.)
