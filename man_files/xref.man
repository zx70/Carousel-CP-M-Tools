  xref produces a cross-reference list of the symbols in each of the
  specified files on the standard output.  Each symbol is listed followed by
  the number(s) of the line(s) on which it appears.  If no files are given or
  a dash (-) is entered in place of a file name, xref reads the standard
  input. 

  A symbol is defined as a letter followed by letters, digits, underlines, or
  periods. 

  Normally, xref treats upper- and lower-case letters as different
  characters.  The -f option causes all letters to be treated as lower-case.

    The file contains too many symbols or references to fit within the
    current limitations of xref.  The size of the buffer is determined by the
    MAXBUF definition in the source code.

  There should be a means of suppressing junk symbols such as "the", "a",
  etc. 

  Symbols exceeding an internal limit are truncated.  This limit is
  determined by the MAXTOK definition in the source code.
