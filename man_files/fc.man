  fc is a script which takes the file named, sends it to the Fortran compiler
  (which the user must supply), and links it with the system library and the
  Software Tools library. 

  The name of the file to be processed must end in .for but the .for should
  not appear when calling fc.  For example,

    fc program

  would compile program.for, and link it, leaving the output on program.com. 

  It is assumed that, if necessary, the file has already been processed by
  the ratfor and fsort tools. 

  fc will usually need to be tailored by the user to fetch the files from the
  directories in which they reside.

  Assuming file is the name of the file passed:

  file.for  - Fortran input
  file.rel  - Fortran output sent to linker
  file.com  - executable output
  Microsoft F80 Fortran compiler (supplied by the user)
  Microsoft L80 linker (supplied by the user)
  ratlib.rel - Software Tools library file
  runsys.rel - Software Tools runtime system
  forlib.rel - Microsoft Fortran library (supplied by the user)

  fsort - sort Fortran specification statements

  Any diagnostics received will be from the individual tools in the script

  A more elaborate script could be made which handles multiple input files.
