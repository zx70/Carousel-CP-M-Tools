  form reads input files and writes them to the standard output.  Any time it
  encounters characters surrounded by left and right arrows (< and >), it
  prints the string between the characters as a prompt for information from
  the user.  It then reads from the standard input and replaces the enclosed
  string with what was read. 

  Normally only one line is accepted from the standard input.  However, a
  response can be continued on succeeding lines by terminating each line with
  a dash (-). 

  The prompts inside the file may also span line boundaries if so desired.
  (No trailing minus is necessary here.)

  The user's answers to prompts are remembered, so duplicate prompts are
  replaced without repeating the prompt to the user. 

  If the standard input is not a terminal, no prompts are issued.

  Prepare the file letter with the following:

    MEMO

    TO:    <Name>
    FROM:  Your illustrious supervisor

    I regret to inform you that your services are no longer
    required as of <date>.
    Your <years of service> years here have been appreciated.
    You may pick up your final check on <date>.

  Then, using form:

    form letter >joe

  would result in prompts to you for the name, date (only once), and _____years __of
  _______service. 

  You might want to read the answers to the prompts from a file, and you
  might often want to embed formatting commands in your file.  Try form this
  way:

    form <info letter | format >joe

  If an input file cannot be opened, a message is printed and execution is
  terminated. 

  A message is also printed if either the prompt or the response is too long
  for form''s internal buffer.

  There should be a way for form to loop through a series of inputs (e.g.,
  when generating the same form letter to a list of addressees).
