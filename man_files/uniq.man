  uniq reads the input file(s), comparing adjacent lines.  Second and
  succeeding copies of repeated lines are removed; the remainder is written
  to standard output. 

  If the -c flag is given, each line is preceded by a count of the number of
  occurrences of that line.

  tr <doc A-Z a-z |@
  tr !a-z "@n" |@
  sort |@
  uniq -c |@
  sort -r >histogram
    converts letters in file doc to lower case, discards numbers, punctuation
    and spaces and puts every word on a line by itself, sorts them, counts
    the number of occurrences of each word, and finally sorts the
    occurrences, thus producing a simple histogram of word usage.
