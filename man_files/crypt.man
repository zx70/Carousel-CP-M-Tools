  crypt encrypts characters on the standard input by using key.  The file can
  eventually be decrypted by running it back through crypt with the same
  key.  Multiple encryption (encrypting a file with first one key and then
  another) is allowable. 

  The size of the encryption key is limited by the MAXKEY definition in the
  source code.

  crypt <loveletters some-weird-key >safe
  rm loveletters
    encrypt loveletters using the key some-wierd-key, saving the output on
    safe.  The original file is then removed. 

  crypt <mail key1 | crypt key2 >safemail
    encrypt mail twice, with 2 different keys, for extra safety. 

  crypt <safemail key2 | crypt key1 >mail
    de-crypt the previous example.
