  ld is a script which takes the named file and links it with the system
  library and the Software Tools library.  ld results in a .tol file version
  of the new Tool.  If a .com version is desired the install Tool must be
  used. 

  The name of the file to be processed must end in .rel, but the .rel should
  not appear when calling ld.  For example,

    ld program

  would link program.rel', searching the appropriate system and Software
  Tools libraries, leaving the output on program.com'. 

  It is assumed that, if necessary, the file has already been processed by
  ratfor, fsort, and the Fortran compiler. 

  ld will usually need to be tailored by the user to fetch the files from the
  directories in which they reside.

  Assuming file is the name of the file passed:

  file.rel - output from Fortran compiler
  file.com - executable output
  Microsoft L80 linker (supplied by the user)
  ratlib.rel - the file containing the Software Tools library
  runsys.rel - Software Tools run time system
  forlib.rel - Microsoft Fortran library (supplied by the user)

  A more elaborate script could be made which handles multiple input files.
