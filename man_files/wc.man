  wc prints the number of lines, words, and characters in the named files.  A
  total is also printed.  Entering a dash (-) in place of a file name
  specifies that standard input is to be read.  A "word" is any sequence of
  characters delimited by white space (tabs or blanks). 

  The options -l, -w, and -c specify, respectively, that only the line, word,
  or character count be printed.  For example,

    wc -lc foo

  prints the number of lines and characters in foo. 

  If no files are given, wc reads its standard input and the total count is
  suppressed.
