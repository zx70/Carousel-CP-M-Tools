  find searches the standard input file for lines containing the expr(s) and
  treats them according to the criteria specified by the flags.  Up to nine
  expr may be specified.  An expr is a regular expression as described in the
  writeup on ed.  By default a line which matches any one of the expressions
  is considered a matching line and is printed on the standard output. 

  The following may be used to alter what is done with matching lines:

  -a only lines which match all given expressions in any order are considered
    to match. 

  -x all lines which dddooo nnnooottt satisfy the given expression(s) are considered
    matching lines. 

  -c matching lines are counted instead of being copied to the standard
    output, and only the final count is written to standard output. 

  The -c option may be specified with either the -a or -x commands (e.g.,
  -cx).

    Jones. 

  find <namelist -a Sm?th Jones
    search through namelist and print all lines containing Smith or Smyth (or
    Smxth, Sm-th, etc.) and Jones. 

  find <wordlist "%???$"
    search through wordlist and find all lines that contain only three
    characters. 

  find <data "[!-][0-9][0-9]*" >numbers
    look through data, writing any lines containing positive numbers to file
    numbers. 

  find <archive -a #@-h- abort
    search through archive and print the lines which start with ____#-h- (archive
    header lines) and are followed by any occurrence of the word abort.  This
    is especially useful when searching program archives for calls to
    particular functions, etc.
