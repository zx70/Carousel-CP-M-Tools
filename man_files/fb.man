  fb (find block) searches for blocks or groups of lines in a file that
  contain specified text patterns.  It is similar to find except that if a
  pattern is found, the entire block of lines is copied to standard output,
  rather than simply the line in which the pattern occurred.  Thus, it is
  useful for searching mailing lists, bibliographies, and similar files where
  several lines are grouped together to form cohesive units. 

  The search patterns may be any regular expression as described in the ed
  writeup. 

  fb assumes the blocks of lines are separated by an empty line or a line
  containing only blanks.  When fb is called without any options or flags,
  standard input is read and each line is checked to see if it matches any of
  the regular expressions given as arguments.  If any matches are found, the
  entire block is written to standard output. 

  Care should be taken when using the characters % $ [ ] ! * @ and any shell
  characters in the text pattern.  It is often necessary (and never hurts) to
  enclose the entire substitution pattern in quotes. 

  _______Options _______Summary       
  -a Print block only if all test expressions are matched. 

  -x Print block only if none of the test expressions are matched. 

  -c Print only the number of blocks that match (-a) or do not match (-x) the
    test expressions. 

  -s expr 
    Use the expression following the -s as the block separator.  If two -s
    flags are specified the first is the beginning of the block (e.g.,
    -ssubroutine), and the second is the end of the block (e.g., -send). 

  -lN Prints only the first N lines of the block.  If the block contains less
    than N lines, the block written will be padded out with blank lines. 

  The commands -a and -x may be specified with c (e.g., -ac).

  fb <phonelist George Harry
    Locate the blocks containing the names George and/or Harry in phonelist. 

  fb <address -l9 % >yourprinter
    Locates all addresses in address which contain a beginning-of-line (i.e.
    all addresses) and prints them in blocks of 9 lines.  This might be used
    for producing mailing labels. 

  fb <program -ssubroutine -send "call abort" >rtns
    Searches program for all subroutines (but not functions), that call abort
    and saves them in rtns. 

  find < prog.ar #-h- error | fb -s#-h- error | pr >/lst
    Assuming you have an archive file prog.ar that has each routine as one
    member of the archive, find all archive headers ("#-h-" - the name of the
    file is on the same line) and all lines with the word error, and print
    the archive header line and line(s) with error.  Archive header lines
    that are not followed by a line with error will not be printed.

  Error messages are given if:

    1) One of the patterns given is illegal

    2) More than 2 separators are given with -s

    3) More than 9 expressions are specified

    4) There are problems opening the scratch file

  The following messages indicate something is dreadfully wrong:

    1) Illegal default separator

    2) Block buffer overflow
