  split splits a file into a number of small files.  Depending on the
  arguments, file is split into files of N lines or according to specified
  patterns. 

  Normally, split outputs the pieces of file into files named xaa, xab, xac,
  ..., xzz.  This convention permits up to 676 files.  If spliting file
  requires more than 676 files to be created, the rest of file is placed in
  xzz.  If the name argument is given, it is used as the prefix for the
  output file names, instead of the letter "x".  For each output file, the
  2-character sequence (i.e., aa, ab, etc.) is appended to name and the
  result is used as the output file. 

  If no file name is specified or a dash (-) is entered in place of the file
  name, split reads the standard input.  Note that file (or -) must be given
  in order to specify name. 

  If -N is omitted, 100 is assumed. 

  The command form

    split +from file [name]

  splits file into pieces that begin with the pattern from.  The command form

    split +from -to file [name]

  splits file into pieces that begin with the pattern from and end with the
  pattern to.  Note that in this case, portions of file may not appear in the
  output files. 

  The from and to patterns may be any regular expression pattern as described
  in ed.

  split +subroutine -end foo
    extracts the subroutines (but not the functions) from foo. 

  split bigfile part. 
    splits bigfile into 100-line pieces and puts them onto files named
    ____part.__aa, ____part.__ab etc. 

  split -1000 bigfile
    splits bigfile into 1000-line pieces and puts them on files names ___xaa,
    ___xab, ___xac, etc. 

  split +program "-% *end" library
    extracts all main programs from library and puts them on files ___xaa, ___xab,
    etc.
