  format formats text according to request lines embedded in the text of the
  files to be formatted, or standard input if no files are given.  If
  nonexistent filenames are encountered they are ignored. 

  Input consists of intermixed text lines, which contain information to be
  formatted, and request lines, which contain instructions about how to
  format the text lines.  The requests are listed in the "Request Summary"
  below.  Request lines begin with a distinguishing control character,
  normally a period, in the first column.  Lines that begin with the control
  character that are not recognized as requests are ignored. 

  Output lines are normally filled; that is words from as many input lines as
  necessary are accumulated on the output line until the next word will not
  fit.  A filled output line may be justified by adding blanks between words
  until the output line extends to the right margin.  Blanks on the input
  lines, including blanks at the end, are always retained so the output line
  will contain at least as many spaces between words as the input line.
  However, input lines beginning with a space are output without
  modification. 

  Line breaks may be caused at specified places by certain commands, or by
  the appearance of an empty input line or an input line beginning with a
  space. 

  Headers and footers may appear at the top and bottom of every page.  A
  header or footer specification consists of a line with three distinct
  fields: the first is text to be placed flush with the left margin, the
  second centered, and the third flush with the right margin.  The first
  non-blank character in the title will be used as the delimiter to separate
  the three fields.  Any sharp (#) signs in a title  are replaced by the
  current page number, and any percent (%) signs are replaced by the current
  date.  For example,

    .fo '%'page #'DRAFT'

  will print a footer with the date in the left corner, "page" followed by
  the page number in the center, and the word DRAFT in the right corner. 

  The .nr request defines number registers; there are 26 registers, each
  named with a letter of the alphabet.  The command

    .nr x 3

  sets number register x to 3;

    .nr x +1

  increments number register x by 1; and

    .nr x -2

  decrements x by 2.  The value of number register x is placed in the text by
  the appearance of @n'x; a literal @ may be inserted using @@.  Number
  registers can be used to hold, for example, the amount of indent to be used
  in displays.  For example,

    .nr i 3
    ...
    .in +@ni
    ...
    .in -@ni


  Additional commands may be defined using .de xx, where xx is one or two
  characters.  For example,

    .de PG
    .sp
    .ti +3
    .en

  defines PG which may be specified on a line by itself as

    .PG

  to start an indented paragraph. 

  Defined commands may also be invoked with arguments.  Arguments are
  separated by blanks or tabs.  Within the definition of a defined command,
  arguments are referenced using $1, $2, etc.  There is a maximum of 9
  arguments.  Omitted arguments default to the null string.  $0 references
  the command name itself.  For example, the following version of the
  paragraph command uses the argument to determine the amount of
  indentation. 

    .de PG
    .sp
    .ti +$1
    .en

  This command could be invoked by

    .PG 3

  to get the same effect as the previous version. 

  The .so file command causes the contents of file to be inserted in place of
  the .so command; .so commands may be nested. 

  _______Options _______Summary       
  +N Starts printing at the first page numbered N.  (E.g., +5 would start on
    page 5.)

  -N Stops printing after the page numbered N.  (E.g., -5 would stop after
    page 5.)

  -s Causes format to stop printing before each page, including the first
    page.  This is useful for paper manipulation.  The prompt "Type return to
    begin a page" is given just once before the first page. 

  -poN
    Moves the entire document N spaces to the right.  The default value is
    zero.  (E.g., -po10 would move the document 10 spaces to the right.)

  format document
    format document and send the output to the terminal. 

  ar -p book | format -s > /lst
    extract all the members of the archive book, format them, and send them
    to the printer, stopping before each page to allow for paper insertion. 

  format +7 file1 file2 file3 | crt
    format the three files and, starting with page 7, send the output to the
    terminal.  crt will stop it after every 23 lines. 

  format doc > /lst
    format doc and send it to the printer.

  invalid number register name
    Names of number registers must be a single letter (a through z). 

  missing name in command definition
    A macro was defined using the .de request, but no name for it was given. 

  so commands nested too deeply
    The limit for nesting included source files is dependent upon the
    MAXOFILES definition in the standard symbols definition file. 

  too many characters pushed back
    The buffer holding input characters has been exceeded; its size is
    determined by the BUFSIZE definition in the source code.

  Numerical values are denoted by N and single characters by C.  Numbers may
  be signed positive (+) or negative (-), in which case they signify relative
  changes to a quantity; otherwise they signify an absolute setting.  Missing
  N fields are ordinarily taken to be 1 and missing C fields shut off the
  appropriate special interpretation.
