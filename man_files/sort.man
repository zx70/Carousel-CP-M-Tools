  sort sorts lines from all the named files together and writes the result on
  the standard output.  If no files are given or a dash (-) is entered in
  place of a file name, standard output is read. 

  The sort key is an entire line.  Default ordering is alphabetic by
  characters as they are represented in ASCII format.  The ordering is
  affected by the following flags, one or more of which may appear. 

  -b Leading blanks are not included in keys. 

  -d "Dictionary" order: only letters, digits and blanks are significant in
    comparisons. 

  -f Consider all letters to be a single case. 

  -i Ignore all nonprinting nonblank characters. 

  -m Merge only, the input files are already sorted. 

  -r Reverse the sense of the sort. 

  +sN Sort according to the subfield starting on column N.

  sort file1 file2 >sorted
    sort file1 and file2 together, placing the output on sorted. 

  sort -d wordlist dict >newdict
    sort wordlist together with dict, with only letters, digits, and blanks
    being significant.  Save the output on newdict. 

  ar -t archfile | sort -f
    sort the member names of an archive file, folding all letters to a single
    case.  Send output to the user's terminal. 

  sort +s10 data
    in data, sort on the field which begins in column 10.

  file:  can't open
    This message is printed if either an input file or a scratch file cannot
    be opened; execution ceases. 

  too many arguments
    printed if too many files are specified on the command line.  The limit
    is determined by the FLMAX definition in the source code.

  The merge phase is performed with a polyphase merge/sort algorithm, which
  requires an end-of-run delimiter on the scratch files.  The one chosen is a
  bare ^D (ASCII code 4) on a line.  If this is in conflict with your data
  files, the symbol CTRLD in the sort symbol definitions should be
  redefined.
