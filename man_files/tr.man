  tr copies the standard input to the standard output substituting or
  deleting selected characters.  Characters found in from are changed into
  the corresponding characters of to.  Ranges of characters may be specified
  by separating the extremes by a dash.  For example, a-z stands for the
  string of characters whose ASCII codes run from character a through
  character z. 

  If the number of characters in from is the same as in to, each character in
  from will be replaced by the character in the same relative position in
  to.  For example,

    tr 123 xyz

  would change all occurences of 1 to x, 2 to y and 3 to z. 

  If the number of characters in from is more than that in to, the last
  character in to is to be replicated as often as necessary to make a string
  as long as from, but the replicated characters will never appear twice in
  succession in the output.  For example,

    tr 1-9 N

  would change each occurence of one or more digits into the single character
  N.  (The range "1-9" is equivalent to entering "123456789".)

  If to is missing or empty, tr will delete all occurrences of the characters
  in from.  If to is longer than from, the extraneous characters are
  ignored. 

  tr differs from the tool ch in that tr deals only with single characters or
  ranges of characters, while ch deals with character strings.  For example

    tr xy yx

  would change all x's into y's and all y's into x's, whereas

    ch xy yx

  changes all the patterns xy into yx. 

  One of the most common functions of  tr is to translate upper case letters
  to lower case, and vice versa.  Thus,

    tr A-Z a-z

  would change all upper case letters to lower case.

  tr <doc A-Z a-z >newdoc
    translate all the upper case letters in doc to lower case and write the
    new data in newdoc. 

  tr <doc !a-zA-Z "@n" | sort | uniq
    changes all non-alphabetic characters to a NEWLINE.  That is, it puts all
    words in doc on a line by themselves.  The list is then sorted and
    duplicates are stripped.  The result, a list of the words in doc, is then
    printed on the terminal. 

  tr <file !0-9@n
    deletes everything but digits and NEWLINES from a file and prints the
    result on the terminal.

  usage: tr from to. 
    The command line is in error. 

  from: too large. 
    The string for from is too large.  The current limit is 100 characters
    including the end-of-string indicator. 

  to: too large. 
    The string for to is too large.  The current limit is 100 characters
    including the end-of-string indicator.
