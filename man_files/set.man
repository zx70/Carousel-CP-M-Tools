  set is used to list, set, or unset certain variables that control how the
  shell works.  The variables are maintained in the file sh.env which must be
  on the shell default directory. 

  The -v option prints the current value of the variable(s) listed, or all of
  the variables if none are specified. 

  Variable values may be set by specifying the variable name and the
  value(s).  Flag variables may be set or unset by specifying the values ON
  or OFF respectively.  The variable's names and values may be specified in
  upper or lower case. 

  The variables are discussed below.  The values shown are typical for a
  system with two floppy disk drives, unless otherwise noted.  Directory
  names for TEMP and PATH must be in a form suitable for prefixing to a file
  name (e.g., /a/ or a: instead of /a.)

  TAB  8
    This is used to specify the tab character (Control-I) width to Tools that
    write to character devices such as the printer (/lst), terminal (/tty),
    punch, etc.  Tab characters are always replaced by an appropriate number
    of blanks when writing to character devices.  This variable gives you a
    way to change the width of tabs. 

  DATE  1983    8   25    13   14   59    0
    This is set only by the date Tool.  The value is used by Tools such as
    __ar, ______format, __pr, etc.  The digits specify the year, month, day, hour,
    minute, seconds, and fractional seconds of the day. 

  MAXDEV B
    The last disk drive on the system.  This is used by the Tools when
    checking for errors in file names: if a directory name is beyond the
    value specified for MAXDEV the Tool will give you a polite error instead
    of letting the system say something nasty. 

  TEMP /0/B/
    The user number and disk where temporary files used by the Tools are to
    be written.  Tool temporary files always have a file name extension of
    .$$$. 

  ATEND 0A:SH.TOL
    The full pathname to the shell Tool if the shell is being used; otherwise
    empty.  This is maintained by the shell. 

  PATH 0A: . 
  PATH /1/C/ /2/C/ . 
    Directory names to be searched in the order specified for locating Tools
    and other commands.  The lone period (.) indicates the current directory
    is to be searched.  The names are prefixed to the specified command
    name.  The first is appropriate for a two disk drive floppy system, the
    second for a hard disk system. 

  EXT .TOL .COM . 
    File name extensions to be appended to any commands entered.  The lone
    period (.) indicates no extension.  Each extension is tried in the order
    specified in each directory in PATH before the next directory is
    searched. 

  CTRLC
    If this variable is present the Tools are sensitive to Control-C being
    entered.  (Entering Control-C will cause the executing program to stop.)

  VERBOSE
    Causes the shell to print each command line or line from a script as it
    is read.  (This flag may also be set by the -v option to the shell.)

  LIST
    Causes the shell or other Tool, just as it finishes executing, to print
    the next command to be executed in the actual format the system expects.
    (This flag may also be set by the -x option to the shell.)

EEEXXXAAAMMMPPPLLLEEESSS        
  set -v path
    Print the current set of directories that will be searched for any
    commands entered. 

  set list on
    Have each command line printed just before it is executed. 

  set temp /15/a/
    Use user 15 on disk a for temporary files.  (That way they are not seen
    unless you look for them.)

  set maxdev b
    Indicate that there are only 2 drives on the system.
