The rat4 compiler is constructed from and documented in this archive.
The file "build.tmp" contains a list of all primary archive members.
These consist of rat4.doc, readme, several lists of sub-archive file
members, include files, and rat4 in four parts.  The first part,
"rat4.rat" contains the defns and include commands to fetch the
three main blocks of code (which are in "rat4x.rat", x=1,2,3).
The corresponding .lst files are used to build the three main chunks.
The "list" file is a list of all members that are needed to make rat4.
a complete sequence might be:
ar xv rat4.ar
ar xv rat4.rat
ar xv rat41.rat
ar xv rat42.rat
ar xv rat43.rat
; this leaves all files extracted
; make changes desired
; then put it all back
ar uv rat4.rat - <rat4.lst
ar uv rat41.rat - <rat41.lst
ar uv rat42.rat - <rat42.lst
ar uv rat43.rat - <rat43.lst
ar uv rat4.ar - <build.tmp
